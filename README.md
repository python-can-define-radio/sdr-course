# Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Course

 - [Daily Schedule of Events](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/resources/toc/7day.md)

## Where to start:

Start with the [classroom_activities](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/tree/main/classroom_activities).

## Some background info:

This is an in-progress collection of tutorials about the foundations of Software Defined Radios. Readers are encouraged to supplement with [other resources](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/resources/README.md).

## Possible hardware:

 - [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) -- Top recommendation due to low cost; receive only
 - [Tiny Spectrum Analyzer](https://www.tinysa.org/) -- Second lowest cost (around $90); built-in screen; can transmit and receive. From what we can tell, it doesn't have full SDR capabilities, but it's great for scanning.
 - [PlutoSDR](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html#eb-overview)  -- Second recommendation due to full-duplex ability
 - [HackRF One](https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) -- half-duplex
 - Nooelec NESDR SMArt: receive only
