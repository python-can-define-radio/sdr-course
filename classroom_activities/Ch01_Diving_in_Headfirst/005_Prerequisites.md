# Prerequisites

1. We recommend learning **Marimo** through [this lesson in the Python course](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/python-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/Ch02_Advanced/01_marimo.md) before proceeding because many elements of the SDR-course will refer back to concepts from that lesson.

2. Converting between different frequency units is essential to fluent radio usage. [This set of exercises](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/resources/unit-conversion-review.md) provides a review.
