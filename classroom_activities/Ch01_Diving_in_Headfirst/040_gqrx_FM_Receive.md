# gqrx FM Receive  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember to respect your fellow classmates (audio level) they may be trying to work as well.**  
## Initial setup    
- Attach an SDR device, e.g. a HackRF One, to your computer
- Open a terminal (command line interface or CLI) window on your üñ•Ô∏è computer.  
- The first time you launch gqrx you may want to reset to its default settings using the terminal command below.  
  `$ gqrx -r`    
- On the Configure I/O devices window select the "device" dropdown menu.
  - Choose the first HackRF entry which should look something like this:  
  - HackRF HackRF One `123456f` (the numbers are a partial serial number of the device) 
  - Change the input rate to `20000000`, and press the "OK" button at the bottom.
- Maximize your gqrx window.
- Check the audio volume level on your computer.  Set it to low or moderate as a starting point.
- Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play button in the top left under "File".  
- You should see some noise and spikes in the spectrum display.
- If you do not hear any static ensure your üñ•Ô∏è computer audio settings are enabled.  
- If you still do not hear any static you may need to adjust your gain slider on the Audio pane (bottom right within gqrx).  

## Settings     
‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep the RF gain at zero.** ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- **Frequency**  
  - Tune your frequency to `98.000.000`, which means 98 Million Hz, or 98 MHz. (This should allow you to see everything from 88 to 108 MHz "The FM band".) (Note: periods are used in place of commas to separate place values for one thousand, one million, etc.)
  - gqrx can be tuned either in the spectrum view window or in the Receiver Options pane (on the right).
  - In the spectrum view, clicking on the top of the numbers increases, and clicking on the bottom of the numbers decreases the frequency.  
  - In the Frequency box of the Receiver Options pane, it would be `98000.000 kHz`.
- **Squelch**  
  - With your mouse, click anywhere on the spectrum where there is no spike present.
  - In the receiver options pane (on the right), click the <kbd>A</kbd> button (short for automatic) next to "Squelch".
  - This will readjust the noise floor dB level from `-150` dB to somewhere between `-60` dB and `-80` dB depending on the amount of "noise" present, and the speakers should go silent.  
- **Mode**
  - Using the dropdown menu next to "Mode", select Wideband Frequency Modulation (WFM), either mono or stereo.  
- **Experiment**
  - Click around on different spikes in the spectrum view (some of them will be radio stations).
  - Again you may have to adjust the üñ•Ô∏è computer audio settings and/or the audio gain slider in gqrx for optimal sound quality.  
  - Also remember antenna placement is very important.
  - Other than the RF gain, feel free to play around with the settings. You can always reset to default configuration with the `$ gqrx -r` terminal command.
