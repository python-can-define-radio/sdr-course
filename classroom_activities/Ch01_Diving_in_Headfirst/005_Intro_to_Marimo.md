# Introduction to Marimo

We recommend learning Marimo through [this lesson in the Python course](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/python-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/Ch02_Advanced/01_marimo.md) before proceeding because many elements of the SDR-course will refer back to concepts from that lesson.
