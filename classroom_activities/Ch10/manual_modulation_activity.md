# Manual modulation

### Summary

Most of us have heard terms like amplitude and frequency, but how do we these invisible electromagnetic waves allow us to communicate in our everyday lives? This activity provides an opportunity to explore and experience these concepts.

You'll work in groups of 4 to develop a wireless communication scheme. You'll start with audio, and then move to using EM waves. Each level will incorporate a way to improve the communication scheme.

### Difficulty Level 1

**Directions**: Describe a communication system that uses humming. The system should be able to communicate any single word that is at most five letters long.

**Constraints**:
- You cannot use any visual cues.
- You cannot use any other sounds (clicking, snapping, clapping, spoken words, etc).
- You will not know the word in advance.
- The word will be written using Latin characters (a-z).

**Execution**:
- All student groups will submit their directions anonymously.
- The instructor will briefly look at each submission and decide the order of presentation. Note: the instructor will probably choose to present flawed systems first so as to demonstrate the flaws for learning purposes.
- For each submission, the instructor will...
  - Show the submitted directions on the board and read them aloud.
  - Ask for a pair of students to volunteer to execute the directions. (Ideally, this pair is **not** from the group that submitted the directions. However, maintaining submission anonymity is first priority because the instructor will likely point out flaws in the communication scheme.)
  - Facilitate a discussion of the pros and cons of the approach.

**Conclusion**: If any of the following concepts did not arise naturally during the student presentations, the instructor will present them:
- OOK
- ASK
- FSK

### Difficulty level 2

**Directions**: Describe a communication system that uses the **EMS (ElectroMagnetic Spectrum)**. The system should be able to communicate any single word that is at most five letters long.

**Constraints**:
- You must modulate and demodulate the word by hand.
- You will not know the word in advance.
- The word will be written using Latin characters (a-z).

**Execution**: Same as Level 1.

**Conclusion**: Same as Level 1.

### Difficulty level 3

**Directions**: Same as level 2, but **the transmission must last less than half a second.** Decoding the message must take less than 10 minutes.

**Constraints, Execution, Conclusion**: Same as previous.

### Difficulty level 4

**Directions**: Same as level 3, with the following changes:
- Instead of one word, **you will communicate two sentences**. (max character count will be the same as a single SMS).
- Transmission must last less than **one** second.
- Encoding the message must be reasonably doable in less than 20 minutes.
- Decoding the message must be reasonably doable in less than 20 minutes.

**Constraints, Execution, Conclusion**: Same as previous.

### Difficulty level 5

**Directions**: Same as level 4, with the following changes:
- Must include Forward Error Correction encoding that can survive a single burst of noise. The length of the noise burst will be no more than 5% of the total transmission time. The FEC encoding and decoding must be doable by hand with only a 4-operation calculator.
- Time to encode: less than an hour. Time to decode: less than an hour.

### Difficulty level 6

**Directions**: Same as level 5, with the following changes:
- The communication must be **encrypted**. Encryption must be (a) doable by hand, and (b) must take at least 10 attempts to break using brute force.
- Time to encrypt: less than 30 min. Time to encode: less than 20 min.
- Time to decrypt: less than 30 min. Time to decode: less than 20 min.
