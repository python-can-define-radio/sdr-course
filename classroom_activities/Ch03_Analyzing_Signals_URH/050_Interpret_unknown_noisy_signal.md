# <!-- pandoc-only LSA 5: --> Interpret a noisy signal using URH üìª

### Download file

- Launch urh and open your folder.

- Click on the Interpretation tab at the top of the urh window.

- Download the following file from github [unknown signal 2](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/raw/main/classroom_activities/Ch03_Analyzing_Signals_URH/unknown_signal_2.complex).

- Put it in your folder.

- Click and drag the signal and drop it to the right (On the Interpretation tab).

- The first thing we need to do is clean up the `noisy` signal by adding a filter.

### Add a filter

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

- Change the Signal View to `Spectrogram`. 
- You should see something like this.

</div>
<div class="column">

![unknown signal 2 spectrogram](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/Ch03_Analyzing_Signals_URH/Images/unknown_signal_2_spectrogram.png?raw=true) 

</div>
</div>

<!-- pandoc-only ### Add a filter -->

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

- Now highlight the signal vertically as shown.

</div>
<div class="column">

</div>
</div>

<!-- pandoc-only ### Add a filter -->

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

- Now somewhere in the reddish area right-click and select `Apply bandpass filter (filter bw=0.08)`.

- Now you should see both signals in the window like this.

- Don't worry if your filtered signal looks different.

</div>
<div class="column">

</div>
</div>

### Save your file

- Now you can close the first unfiltered signal by clicking the red ‚úñÔ∏è on the top signal.

- Its probably a good idea to save this new filtered signal, click the üíæ icon in the Interpretation tab window.

- Give it a new name like `unknown_signal_2_filtered.complex` do not save over your original signal in case you need to start over for any reason.

### Interpret the signal

- Go back to Signal View `Analog` and determine signals [`modulation`](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/Ch03_Analyzing_Signals_URH/020_Modulation.md) type as in previous lesson.

- Now we need to adjust the `Center` setting.

- Initially set your `Noise` and your `Center` settings to `0` if it isn't already.

<!-- pandoc-only ### Interpret the signal -->

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

- Change the Signal View to `Demodulated`.

- If the signal is "weak" you may need to adjust the Y-Scale using the slider on the right, to get a better look at the signal.

<div class="column">

</div>
</div>

<!-- pandoc-only ### Interpret the signal -->

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

- You can click and drag the line (between purple and green) so that it rests somewhere between your high `1` and your low `0` like this.
    
</div>
<div class="column">

![unknown signal 2 set center](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/Ch03_Analyzing_Signals_URH/Images/unknown_signal_2_centerset.png?raw=true)

</div>
</div>

### Get the message

- Determine signals `Samples/Symbol`.

- Set Show data as to `ASCII` and verify all settings to reveal your message.

<!-- ### Additional practice

As in the previous lesson you can also generate noisy signals for practice using this Python code:

```python3
from pcdr.v0_compat import generate_ook_modulated_example_file
generate_ook_modulated_example_file("my_example_ook_file.complex", noise=True)
``` -->
