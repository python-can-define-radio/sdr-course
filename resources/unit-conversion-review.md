# Unit conversions

Many of us have heard frequency units mentioned, for example, when buying a router that has 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz capability. This lesson discusses how to convert between different frequency units, and how to express those using scientific notation (e.g., `2.4e9` = 2.4 GHz).

### Reference Table

|                    | 1 Hz | 1 kHz    | 1 MHz        | 1 GHz            |
|--------------------|------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Converted to Hz    | 1 Hz | 1,000 Hz | 1,000,000 Hz | 1,000,000,000 Hz | 
| Scientific notation| 1 Hz | 1e3 Hz   | 1e6 Hz       | 1e9 Hz           |

### Reviewing the basics

Most of us learned fairly early in school how to say numbers like these:

- 23,000 = twenty three thousand
- 6,200,000 = six point two million

We may also have experience saying these numbers using metric prefixes:

- 23,000 Hz = twenty three thousand Hertz = twenty three kilohertz
- 6,200,000 = six point two million Hertz = six point two Megahertz

The challenge often arises when we need to convert between, for example, Gigahertz and Megahertz. For example, how would you express 2 GHz in Megahertz? We are going to try to use an intuitive approach.

## Exercise 1
## Given: 1 GHz = 1,000 MHz
## Determine the following:
## 2 GHz = ___ MHz
