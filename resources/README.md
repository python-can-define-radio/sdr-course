- https://wirelesspi.com/
- [RTL-SDR Blog](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/): Software defined radio news and projects.
  - Includes some tutorials, but mostly I recommend this for:
    - Inspiration (they post cool news), or
    - To buy a real (non-counterfeit) RTL-SDR.
- [Ettus SDR Tutorials](https://files.ettus.com/tutorials/)
- [Wave Walker DSP](https://www.wavewalkerdsp.com/)
  - Many tutorials. Fairly mathy. Some good foundational info too, such as:
    - [Why are Sinusoids used in DSP and RF?](https://www.wavewalkerdsp.com/2021/09/18/why-are-sinusoids-used-in-dsp-and-rf/)
    - [Signal and Noise: The Vocabulary of RF](https://www.wavewalkerdsp.com/2021/08/31/signal-and-noise-the-vocabulary-of-rf/)
- [Morse code example](https://github.com/duggabe/gr-morse-code-gen)
- [FM Reception with the GNU Radio Companion](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/fm-reception-with-the-gnu-radio-companion): Great tutorial. Includes:
  - How to listen to FM
  - How to get the digital data (current song name, etc)
- [Gnuradio Mini Projects](https://udel.edu/~mm/gr/): A variety of projects.
- [DSP Illustrations](https://dspillustrations.com/): DSP using Python. 
- ["But what is a Fourier series? From heat flow to drawing with circles | DE4"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) Has cool animations. Pretty heavy math.

Other cool stuff:
- ["Kid krypto": Public Key encryption](https://classic.csunplugged.org/documents/activities/public-key-encryption/unplugged-18-public_key_encryption_0.pdf): Don't let the name fool you -- this is the best explanation of Public Key Encryption that I've seen. It does require some reading, but it well worth it. Also see [source](https://classic.csunplugged.org/activities/public-key-encryption/) and [an interesting subsequent work](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1177112.pdf)

Not as cool, but worth saving for other reasons:
- [Behind the Veil: A Peek at GNU Radio’s Buffer Architecture](https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/2017-01-05-buffers/) -- This explains why the size of a chunk-of-data-provided-to-a-block varies.
