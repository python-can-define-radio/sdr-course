    - Inspiration (they post cool news), or
    - To buy a real (non-counterfeit) RTL-SDR.
- [Ettus SDR Tutorials](https://files.ettus.com/tutorials/)
- [Wave Walker DSP](https://www.wavewalkerdsp.com/)
  - Many tutorials. Fairly mathy. Some good foundational info too, such as:
    - [Why are Sinusoids used in DSP and RF?](https://www.wavewalkerdsp.com/2021/09/18/why-are-sinusoids-used-in-dsp-and-rf/)

- [FM Reception with the GNU Radio Companion](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/fm-reception-with-the-gnu-radio-companion): Great tutorial. Includes:
  - How to listen to FM
  - How to get the digital data (current song name, etc)
- [Gnuradio Mini Projects](https://udel.edu/~mm/gr/): A variety of projects.
- [DSP Illustrations](https://dspillustrations.com/): DSP using Python.
